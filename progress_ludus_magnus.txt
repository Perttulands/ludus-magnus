# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---
## Iteration 1 - Project scaffolding and Go module setup
- What was implemented
  - Added root CLI scaffolding files: `main.go` and `cmd/root.go` with cobra root command (`ludus-magnus`)
  - Created required package directories with Go files: `internal/state/doc.go` and `internal/engine/doc.go`
  - Added acceptance test: `tests/test_us001_scaffolding.py`
  - Created local Python virtualenv `.venv` to run pytest in this environment
- Files changed
  - main.go
  - cmd/root.go
  - internal/state/doc.go
  - internal/engine/doc.go
  - tests/test_us001_scaffolding.py
  - progress_ludus_magnus.txt
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Patterns discovered
    - This environment has no `go` binary available in PATH, so Go acceptance checks cannot execute
  - Gotchas encountered
    - `pytest` is not installed globally and requires a local virtualenv (`.venv`)
  - Useful context
    - Current blocker for US-001 completion is environment setup (`go` toolchain missing), not scaffolding code edits

**Summary:**
- Task: [US-001: Project scaffolding and Go module setup]
- Files: [main.go, cmd/root.go, internal/state/doc.go, internal/engine/doc.go, tests/test_us001_scaffolding.py, progress_ludus_magnus.txt]
- Tests: [FAIL with count: 1 failed]
- Review: [SKIPPED]
- Next: [US-001]

## Iteration 2 - Project scaffolding and Go module setup
- What was implemented
  - Finalized US-001 scaffolding validation by ensuring root help output includes `ludus-magnus`
  - Updated acceptance test command runner to prepend `/usr/local/go/bin` to PATH so Go commands execute in this environment
  - Re-ran US-001 acceptance test to GREEN
- Files changed
  - cmd/root.go
  - tests/test_us001_scaffolding.py
  - PRD_LUDUS_MAGNUS.md
  - progress_ludus_magnus.txt
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Patterns discovered
    - In this environment, Python subprocesses launched via `bash -lc` need explicit PATH prepending for Go
  - Gotchas encountered
    - Cobra root `--help` output did not include the binary name until `Short` text included `ludus-magnus`
  - Useful context
    - Keep acceptance tests environment-aware when toolchains are installed outside default PATH

**Summary:**
- Task: [US-001: Project scaffolding and Go module setup]
- Files: [cmd/root.go, tests/test_us001_scaffolding.py, PRD_LUDUS_MAGNUS.md, progress_ludus_magnus.txt]
- Tests: [PASS with count: 1 passed]
- Review: [PASSED]
- Next: [US-002]
